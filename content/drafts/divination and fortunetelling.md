Some instruments or practices of divination include [Tarot-card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarot_card_reading "Tarot card reading") reading, [rune casting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runic_magic "Runic magic"), [tea-leaf reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasseography "Tasseography"), [automatic writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_writing "Automatic writing"), water [scrying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrying "Scrying"), and [psychedelics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelics "Psychedelics")
